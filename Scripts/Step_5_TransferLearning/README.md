# Neural Network Transfer Learning with CIFAR-10

This repository contains an implementation of transfer learning using pre-trained neural networks with the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project demonstrates how to extract features from images using both pre-trained networks and custom CNNs, and then use these features to train an SVM (Support Vector Machine) with cross-validation.

## Project Structure

- `FeatureExtractor/`: Contains scripts for feature extraction using neural networks

## Features

- Feature extraction using pre-trained networks from CIFAR-10
- Training custom CNNs for feature extraction
- Classification using lightweight learning machines with cross-validation
- Results visualization and performance metrics

## Requirements

Project requirements are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install all dependencies, follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system:

- [Windows Installation](docs/installation_windows.md)
- [Linux Installation](docs/installation_linux.md)

## Usage

### 1. Feature Extraction

To extract features using the ResNet model:
```bash
 python FeatureExtractor/extract_features.py -model resnet -data_benign ../../IoT_ARM-main/IoT_ARM-main/benign/benign -data_malware ../../IoT_ARM-main/IoT_ARM-main/malware/malware
```

where: "../../IoT_ARM-main/IoT_ARM-main/benign/benign" is your path bening and "./../IoT_ARM-main/IoT_ARM-main/malware/mal" is your path malware


Available options:
- `-model`: Choose between 'resnet' or 'lenet' to use pre-trained models, or any other option to train from scratch

The script will generate a LIBSVM format file: `FeatureExtractor/TransferLearningAntivirus.libsvm`
